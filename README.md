# map

A simple bit of code to look into arrival time projections using
Google Maps Directions API.

## Authentication Note
This code uses an API key which is not checked into the repo.  It's expected to
be in the file '.apikey' in the working directory.

TODO() add environment var support for API key too
TODO() make the API setup a library shared by the test code
TODO() make some testing
